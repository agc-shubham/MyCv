		<h2>Education</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Bachelor of Technology in computer science.</strong>
				<p>During the first two year of course I learned basic courses in computer sciences such as Data structures, Algorithms, Digital logic, Discrete Mathematics, Computer organisation and Architecture, Microprocessors and Microcontrollers and Operating systems.</p>
				<p>In the next two years I went on to learn some advanced courses in Computer science such as DBMS, Computer Networks, Optimization techniques, Automata theory, Distributed systems, Computer Graphics, Internet Technology, Artificial Intelligence.</p>
				<p>Computer Networks grabbed my special attention and I went on apply conceppts which I learned theoretically to put  on application with network simulation tools such as pckt tracer and wireshark. </p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Higher Secondary </strong>
				<p>With the dream of pursuing Engineering as career I specialised in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics during my Higher Secondary School.</p>
				<p>I had a special knack for Physics and semiconductors specially intrigued me. This was also the reason for devlopment of intrest in computer architecture.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Secondary</strong>
				<p>Coming to Secondary school Mathematics was one of favourite topics.</p>
